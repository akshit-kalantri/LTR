# Introduction

Today, the online world is driven by search. Google has become synonymous to looking up information online, Amazon and other e-commerce marketplaces have sophisticated search results catered to the user’s browsing and purchase history and even airline booking services have their algorithms offer the best deals with both prices and travel time considered. Now this magic behind the scenes is something that is a bit more unique than traditional ML, it is an algorithm termed ‘Learning to Rank’ (LTR).

## Files
The Python notebooks contain two instances of the Learning to Rank algorithm being implemented on different datasets. The CSVtoData file is a simple script to convert the CSV file into a mapped usable Python database.

## Conclusion

The algorithm was implemented successfully and a full breakdown of the process and its results can be found in the overview file or in this [blog](https://medium.com/@akshitkalantri98/learning-to-rank-search-smarter-9189c417afb9) published.
